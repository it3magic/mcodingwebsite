## How to Identify Your Headlight Type

The key to identifying your F10 headlights is looking at the **inner eye** section (the smaller inner projector/reflector next to the main beam):

### Halogen Headlights
![BMW F10 halogen headlight showing reflector-based design](/headlights/halogen.png)

**How to spot them:** The inner eye has a **reflector-style high beam section** - no projector lens, just a traditional reflector bowl.

- Option code: **S520A**
- Warm yellow light output
- LED angel eyes (less bright than xenon/LED variants)

**Note:** We don't offer resealing for halogen units - brand new headlights are available from just **€299**, making replacement more cost-effective.

---

### Non-Adaptive Xenon (Bi-Xenon)
![BMW F10 non-adaptive xenon headlight](/headlights/non-adaptive.png)

**How to spot them:** The inner eye has a **black plastic insert** - a solid black cover with no transparency.

- Option code: **S522A**
- D1S xenon main beam
- LED angel eye DRL lights
- No cornering function

---

### Adaptive Xenon (AHL)
![BMW F10 adaptive xenon headlight with hatched projector lens pattern](/headlights/adaptive.png)

**How to spot them:** The inner eye has a **clear, transparent lens with a lined/hatched pattern** - this is the cornering light that swivels with the steering.

- Option code: **S524A**
- D1S xenon main beam
- LED angel eye DRL lights
- Cornering lights that follow steering input

---

### LED Headlights (LCI Only)

# Why We Recommend Liqui Moly Engine Oil for Your BMW and MINI

At M Coding Ireland, we're often asked which engine oil we recommend for BMW and MINI vehicles. After years of experience servicing hundreds of BMWs and MINIs, our answer is always the same: **Liqui Moly**.

This is a decision backed by science, engineering, and real-world results. Here's why we believe Liqui Moly products are superior and why they're the most used engine oil in our workshop.

## German Engineering Meets German Engineering

**Liqui Moly**, founded in 1957 in Ulm, Germany, has been developing and manufacturing motor oils and additives for nearly seven decades. Their products are designed with the same engineering philosophy that drives BMW: **precision, performance, and uncompromising quality**.

When you pour Liqui Moly into your BMW's engine, you're combining two pinnacles of German engineering excellence.

## BMW-Approved Specifications

BMW engines have specific requirements. BMW issues **Longlife (LL) specifications** that oils must meet to be approved for use in their vehicles. Liqui Moly offers a comprehensive range of BMW-approved oils:

### BMW Longlife-01 (LL-01)
- Designed for petrol engines
- Required for most BMW petrol engines from 2001 onwards
- Excellent cold-start protection
- Superior high-temperature stability

### BMW Longlife-04 (LL-04)
- Formulated for diesel engines with DPF
- Low-SAPS formula protects particulate filters
- Ideal for modern BMW diesel engines
- Extended drain intervals possible

### BMW Longlife-17 FE+ (LL-17 FE+)
- Latest specification for newest BMW engines
- Ultra-low viscosity for maximum fuel efficiency
- Designed for B38, B48, and B58 engines
- Liqui Moly is one of the few manufacturers with this approval

## Why Liqui Moly is Superior

![Liqui Moly TopTec engine oil and Cera Tec products at M Coding Ireland workshop](/LiquiMoly/service-lm2.jpg)
*Our workshop stocked with Liqui Moly products for every BMW service*

### 1. Voted Germany's Best Oil Brand

Liqui Moly has been consistently voted **Germany's best oil brand** by readers of *Auto Bild* and other leading automotive publications. When German motorists—some of the most discerning drivers in the world—overwhelmingly choose Liqui Moly, that's a powerful endorsement.

### 2. Additive Technology

What sets Liqui Moly apart is their proprietary additive technology. Their oils contain specially developed additives that:

- **Reduce friction** between moving parts
- **Prevent wear** on critical engine components
- **Clean deposits** from internal engine surfaces
- **Protect against corrosion** during cold starts
- **Maintain viscosity** across extreme temperature ranges

### 3. MoS2 (Molybdenum Disulfide)

Liqui Moly's name actually comes from their signature ingredient: **Moly** (Molybdenum Disulfide). This microscopic solid lubricant fills in the tiny imperfections in metal surfaces, creating an ultra-smooth protective layer that reduces friction even when oil pressure drops during stop-start driving or high-performance use.

### 4. Made in Germany

While many oil brands are manufactured globally with varying quality standards, **Liqui Moly products are exclusively made in Germany**. This ensures consistent quality, rigorous testing, and adherence to the highest manufacturing standards.

## Real-World Results We See in Our Workshop

### Cleaner Engines

When we service vehicles that have been using Liqui Moly, the difference is visible. Rocker covers come off cleaner, oil passages are clear, and there's noticeably less sludge and carbon buildup compared to engines running on lesser oils.

![Clean BMW engine internals after using Liqui Moly oil showing no sludge or carbon buildup](/LiquiMoly/Clean.PNG)
*Engine internals after consistent Liqui Moly use - clean and protected*

![Dirty BMW engine with sludge and carbon deposits from using low quality engine oil](/LiquiMoly/Dirty.JPEG)
*Compare this to an engine that hasn't been using quality oil with irregular service intervals - the difference is clear*

### Consistent Performance

Whether it's a daily-driven 320d or a track-focused M4, Liqui Moly maintains its protective properties under all driving conditions. The oil doesn't thin out under high temperatures or thicken excessively in cold weather.

### Extended Engine Life

Proper lubrication is the single most important factor in engine longevity. By using superior oil, you're investing in thousands of extra kilometres of reliable service from your engine.

## Which Liqui Moly Oil for Your BMW?

Whether its a petrol powered N55 or the super common diesel N47 we usually recommend **TopTec 4200** and **Molygen 5W30** most new BMW models.

![Liqui Moly Molygen 5W30 engine oil glowing green under UV light for BMW leak detection](/LiquiMoly/molygen.jpg)
*Molygen's distinctive fluorescent additive - makes leak detection easy under UV light*

They are both LL-01 and LL-04 approved and provide:
- Excellent for both daily driving and spirited use
- Superior high-temperature stability
- Low-SAPS formula protects DPF
- Excellent soot-handling properties

### For Older Pre-2002 BMWs
**Liqui Moly MoS2 Leichtlauf 10W-40**
- Extra protection for worn components
- MoS2 additive reduces metal-to-metal contact
- Helps reduce oil consumption

## Liqui Moly Additives We Recommend

Beyond engine oil, Liqui Moly offers a range of additives that provide genuine benefits:

### Cera Tec

![Liqui Moly Cera Tec ceramic wear protection additive for BMW and MINI engines](/LiquiMoly/ceratec1.jpg)
*Cera Tec - ceramic-based wear protection for your engine*

A ceramic-based wear protection additive that reduces friction by up to 20%. We recommend using this product every third service if you stick to our recommendations for oil intervals.

### Engine Flush

![Liqui Moly Engine Flush product for removing sludge and deposits before BMW oil change](/LiquiMoly/flush.jpg)
*Engine Flush dissolves deposits and prepares your engine for fresh oil*

Before oil changes on new-to-us vehicles, we use Liqui Moly Engine Flush to dissolve and remove deposits, sludge, and contaminants. This ensures the new oil can do its job effectively from the first moment. We recommend continuous use until no more deposits can be found in the oil filter.

### Oil Additive (MoS2)
The original Liqui Moly product—a molybdenum disulfide additive that reduces friction and wear in high-mileage engines.

## The Cost of Quality

Yes, Liqui Moly costs more than budget oils. A 5-litre container of premium Liqui Moly may be €15-25 more than a generic alternative. But consider it's a small price to pay as opposed to an engine rebuild.

## Our Oil Change Service

At M Coding Ireland, every oil service includes:

- **Genuine Liqui Moly oil** (BMW LL-01 or LL-04 approved)
- **Liqui Moly Engine Flush** (optional)
- **Liqui Moly Cera Tec additive** (optional)
- **Quality oil filter** (OEM or equivalent)
- **Sump plug washer replacement**
- **Vehicle inspection and fluid top-up**
- **CBS/service indicator reset**

We don't cut corners. Every vehicle that leaves our workshop has the best protection we can provide.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Liqui Moly really better than dealer oil?**

BMW dealers use various oil brands that meet BMW specifications. Liqui Moly not only meets but often exceeds these specifications, with additional additive technology that provides superior protection.

**Q: How often should I change my oil?**

We recommend oil changes every **10,000 km or 12 months**, whichever comes first—regardless of what the BMW service indicator suggests. The factory intervals of 30,000 km are too long.

**Q: Do you stock Liqui Moly for DIY customers?**

We primarily use Liqui Moly for our service customers.

# S55 Engine Exhaust Camshaft Realignment - Fixing the Notorious Cold Start Ticking

If you own a BMW M2 Competition, M3 (F80), or M4 (F82/F83) and have noticed an annoying ticking or tapping noise from the engine bay during cold starts, you're not alone. This is a well-documented issue with the S55 engine that affects many owners.

The good news? It's completely fixable with our professional exhaust camshaft carrier realignment service.

![BMW M4 with S55 Engine](/S55Cam/IMG_3365.JPEG)
*BMW M4 F82 - One of the models affected by the S55 camshaft carrier issue*

## The Problem: Cold Start Ticking Noise

### What Does It Sound Like?

Owners typically describe the noise as:
- A distinct **ticking or tapping** sound from the top end of the engine
- Most noticeable **immediately after cold start**
- Becomes more apparent as engine RPM returns to normal idle speed (around 800-1000 RPM)
- Predominantly heard from the **driver's side of the engine bay**
- The noise usually disappears when the engine warms up, but in some instances if left unresolved for too long, it can be heard at all times

### Which Models Are Affected?

This issue affects S55-powered BMW models, including:
- **BMW M2 Competition** (F87)
- **BMW M3** (F80) - 2014-2018
- **BMW M4** (F82 Coupe / F83 Convertible) - 2014-2018

## The Root Cause: Exhaust Camshaft Carrier Misalignment

The ticking noise is caused by **misalignment of the exhaust camshaft carrier**. Over time and through thermal cycling (heating and cooling of the engine), the camshaft carrier can shift slightly out of its optimal position.

This misalignment affects the valve train geometry, causing:
- Inconsistent valve lash (clearance)
- Increased mechanical noise during cold operation
- Potential for accelerated wear if left unaddressed

**The noise itself doesn't indicate catastrophic engine failure**, but it's an annoyance and can lead to increased wear over time. Many owners find it concerning and want it resolved.

## Book Your S55 Camshaft Realignment

If your BMW M2 Competition, M3, or M4 is suffering from the cold start ticking noise, don't let it continue. Our camshaft carrier realignment service will restore the silent, smooth operation you expect from your M car.

# Why Regular ZF Transmission Service is Critical for Your BMW

If you own a BMW with a ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, you're driving one of the most advanced gearboxes ever made. But like any precision engineering, it requires proper maintenance to keep performing at its best.

## The ZF 8-Speed Advantage

The ZF 8-speed transmission is renowned for its smooth shifts, excellent fuel efficiency, and impressive durability. It's found in everything from the 520d to the 540i, and even in the Toyota Supra. BMW initially marketed it as "lifetime fill," but experience has shown this isn't the full story.

## Why Service Intervals Matter

**The Reality of "Lifetime" Fluid**

While ZF transmissions are incredibly robust, the transmission fluid does degrade over time. Here's why regular servicing matters:

- **Heat Cycling**: Every drive cycle heats and cools the fluid, breaking down its protective properties
- **Contamination**: Metal particles from normal wear accumulate in the fluid and filter
- **Chemical Breakdown**: Additives that protect gears and clutches lose effectiveness

**The 80-120k km Sweet Spot**

Through years of experience servicing BMWs, we've found that servicing the transmission between 80,000-120,000 kilometers prevents issues before they start.

## Book Your Service

At M Coding Ireland, we use dealer-level diagnostic tools and follow BMW's exact procedures for ZF transmission service.

# Diesel Intake Manifold Cleaning: Essential Preventative Maintenance for Your BMW

Modern diesel BMWs are engineering marvels, but their sophisticated emissions systems create unique maintenance challenges. One of the most critical yet often overlooked services is intake manifold cleaning and intake port walnut blasting.

## The Problem: Carbon Buildup in Diesel Engines

Intake manifolds on modern diesel engines face particularly harsh operating conditions.

**The Deadly Combination**
When oil vapor meets exhaust gases in your intake manifold, they combine to form a sticky, carbon-rich deposit. Over time—typically 80,000-150,000 kilometers—this buildup can become severe enough to cause significant issues.

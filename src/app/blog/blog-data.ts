# S55 Engine Exhaust Camshaft Realignment - Fixing the Notorious Cold Start Ticking

If you own a BMW M2 Competition, M3 (F80), or M4 (F82/F83) and have noticed an annoying ticking or tapping noise from the engine bay during cold starts, you're not alone. This is a well-documented issue with the S55 engine that affects many owners.

The good news? It's completely fixable with our professional exhaust camshaft carrier realignment service.

![BMW M4 with S55 Engine](/S55Cam/IMG_3365.JPEG)
*BMW M4 F82 - One of the models affected by the S55 camshaft carrier issue*

## The Problem: Cold Start Ticking Noise

### What Does It Sound Like?

Owners typically describe the noise as:
- A distinct **ticking or tapping** sound from the top end of the engine
- Most noticeable **immediately after cold start**
- Becomes more apparent as engine RPM returns to normal idle speed (around 800-1000 RPM)
- Predominantly heard from the **driver's side of the engine bay**
- The noise usually disappears when the engine warms up, but in some instances if left unresolved for too long, it can be heard at all times

### Which Models Are Affected?

This issue affects S55-powered BMW models, including:
- **BMW M2 Competition** (F87)
- **BMW M3** (F80) - 2014-2018
- **BMW M4** (F82 Coupe / F83 Convertible) - 2014-2018

## The Root Cause: Exhaust Camshaft Carrier Misalignment

The ticking noise is caused by **misalignment of the exhaust camshaft carrier**. Over time and through thermal cycling (heating and cooling of the engine), the camshaft carrier can shift slightly out of its optimal position.

This misalignment affects the valve train geometry, causing:
- Inconsistent valve lash (clearance)
- Increased mechanical noise during cold operation
- Potential for accelerated wear if left unaddressed

**The noise itself doesn't indicate catastrophic engine failure**, but it's an annoyance and can lead to increased wear over time. Many owners find it concerning and want it resolved.

## The Realignment Procedure

Our comprehensive service includes:

**1. Complete Disassembly**
- Removal of rocker cover and associated components
- Access to camshaft carrier assembly
- Inspection of all related components

**2. Precision Realignment**
- Loosening and precise repositioning of exhaust camshaft carrier
- Use of BMW-specific tooling for accurate alignment
- High-precision torque equipment to ensure correct bolt tension

  - Ensures oil-tight seal when reassembling
  - Prevents future oil leaks

**4. Quality Assurance**
- Verification of alignment using BMW diagnostic procedures
- Torque verification on all fasteners

## Post-Service Recommendations

### Oil and Filter Change (Recommended)

We **strongly recommend** performing an oil and filter change after the camshaft realignment procedure. Here's why:

- The procedure involves opening the valve train, which can introduce small particulates into the oil system
- Fresh oil ensures optimal lubrication of newly aligned components
- Provides peace of mind and extends engine life

![Fresh Oil Change](/S55Cam/IMG_3483.JPEG)
*Fresh oil and filter change - the perfect complement to camshaft realignment*

### New Rocker Cover (Optional - Recommended for Higher Mileage)

For higher mileage S55 engines (typically over 100,000 km), we recommend considering a **new rocker cover** as an optional upgrade:

**Why Replace the Rocker Cover?**
- Over time, the plastic rocker cover can develop micro-cracks
- Oil vapor permeation can cause external oil weeping
- Not only does it prevent future oil leaks, it replaces the PCV valve, a common failure point on the S55 engine
- A new cover provides long-term reliability

**When to Replace:**
- If your rocker cover shows signs of oil seepage
- If the cover has visible cracks or damage
- On engines with over 100,000 kilometers
- During preventive maintenance for peace of mind

## Our Professional Approach

### BMW-Specific Tools and Equipment

We use the correct tools for the job:

    excerpt: "Learn why regular ZF transmission servicing every 80-120k km is essential for maintaining your BMW's performance and longevity.",

# Why Regular ZF Transmission Service is Critical for Your BMW

If you own a BMW with a ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, you're driving one of the most advanced gearboxes ever made. But like any precision engineering, it requires proper maintenance to keep performing at its best.

## The ZF 8-Speed Advantage

The ZF 8-speed transmission is renowned for its smooth shifts, excellent fuel efficiency, and impressive durability. It's found in everything from the 520d to the 540i, and even in the Toyota Supra. BMW initially marketed it as "lifetime fill," but experience has shown this isn't the full story.

## Why Service Intervals Matter

**The Reality of "Lifetime" Fluid**

While ZF transmissions are incredibly robust, the transmission fluid does degrade over time. Here's why regular servicing matters:

- **Heat Cycling**: Every drive cycle heats and cools the fluid, breaking down its protective properties
- **Contamination**: Metal particles from normal wear accumulate in the fluid and filter
- **Chemical Breakdown**: Additives that protect gears and clutches lose effectiveness

**The 80-120k km Sweet Spot**

Through years of experience servicing BMWs, we've found that servicing the transmission between 80,000-120,000 kilometers prevents issues before they start. At this interval:

- The fluid is degraded enough to warrant replacement
- It's early enough to prevent damage from contaminated fluid
- You'll notice improved shift quality immediately after service

## What We Check During Service

Our comprehensive ZF transmission service includes:

1. **Complete fluid replacement** - Using genuine ZF fluid or premium alternatives that exceed manufacturer specifications
2. **Filter replacement** - Removing accumulated debris and metal particles
3. **Pan inspection** - Checking for abnormal wear indicators
4. **Diagnostic scan** - Ensuring all transmission systems are functioning correctly
5. **Road test** - Verifying smooth operation after service

## The Overnight Requirement

One critical aspect of proper ZF transmission service: **your car must be left overnight before the service.**

Why? The transmission fluid needs to cool completely to ambient temperature for accurate capacity measurement. When the transmission is warm, fluid expansion can lead to overfilling or underfilling - both of which can cause problems.

## Cost vs. Replacement

A ZF transmission service costs between €550-€750 depending on your specific model and fluid choice. Compare this to replacement costs:

- Remanufactured ZF transmission: €3,000-€5,000
- New ZF transmission: €8,000-€12,000
- Labour for replacement: €1,500-€2,500

The math is clear: regular servicing is excellent insurance against catastrophic failure.

## Signs Your Transmission Needs Service

Don't wait for problems. But if you notice any of these signs, book a service immediately:

- Delayed engagement when shifting from Park to Drive
- Harsh or jerky shifts
- Transmission "hunting" between gears
- Unusual noises during gear changes
- Check engine light related to transmission codes

## Book Your Service

At M Coding Ireland, we use dealer-level diagnostic tools and follow BMW's exact procedures for ZF transmission service. You can choose between genuine ZF fluid or premium aftermarket options that exceed manufacturer specifications.

# Diesel Intake Manifold Cleaning: Essential Preventative Maintenance for Your BMW

Modern diesel BMWs are engineering marvels, but their sophisticated emissions systems create unique maintenance challenges. One of the most critical yet often overlooked services is intake manifold cleaning and intake port walnut blasting.

## The Problem: Carbon Buildup in Diesel Engines

Intake manifolds on modern diesel engines face particularly harsh operating conditions. Two key systems contribute to progressive carbon contamination:

**The PCV System and Turbocharger**
Your engine's Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system and turbocharger inevitably allow small amounts of oil vapor to pass into the intake system. Under normal conditions, this is perfectly normal.

**Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)**
To reduce NOx emissions, your diesel BMW recirculates exhaust gases back through the intake system. While environmentally beneficial, this introduces soot and combustion byproducts into the intake path.

**The Deadly Combination**
When oil vapor meets exhaust gases in your intake manifold, they combine to form a sticky, carbon-rich deposit. Over time—typically 80,000-150,000 kilometers—this buildup can become severe enough to cause significant issues.

![Carbon buildup in intake manifold](/intake6.jpg)
*Severe carbon contamination restricting airflow in a diesel intake manifold*

## Consequences of Neglecting Intake Cleaning

**Restricted Airflow**
Carbon deposits progressively narrow intake passages and coat internal surfaces, reducing the volume of air reaching your cylinders. This starves the engine of the oxygen it needs for efficient combustion.

**Disrupted Air-Fuel Ratios**
Modern diesel engines rely on precise air-fuel ratios for optimal performance and emissions compliance. Restricted airflow throws these ratios off balance, forcing the ECU to compensate—often unsuccessfully.

![Blocked EGR system with extreme carbon buildup](/blockedEGR.jpg)
*Extreme carbon and soot contamination in EGR system - this is how bad it can get if left unchecked*

**Performance Degradation**
The results are noticeable:
- Reduced power output
- Hesitation and lag on acceleration
- Poor throttle response
- Decreased fuel economy
- Increased emissions

**Swirl Flap Failure: The Catastrophic Risk**
Perhaps most concerning is the risk to your intake swirl flaps. These variable geometry plates optimize airflow at different engine speeds but become seized or damaged by carbon buildup. When swirl flaps break free, they can enter the combustion chamber, causing catastrophic engine damage requiring complete engine replacement.

![Carbon buildup on intake swirl flaps](/intake3.jpg)
*Heavy carbon deposits on swirl flap mechanisms - a ticking time bomb for engine failure*

## Benefits of Professional Intake Manifold Cleaning

Regular intake system maintenance prevents these issues before they occur:

✅ **Preventative Maintenance on Swirl Flaps**
Thorough cleaning removes carbon deposits that can seize swirl flap mechanisms, dramatically reducing the risk of failure. During service, we inspect swirl flap condition and recommend replacement, removal, or blanking if necessary.

✅ **Prevents Air Leaks**
We replace all intake manifold seals and gaskets during service, preventing vacuum leaks that can cause rough running and trigger check engine lights.

✅ **Improves Performance and Fuel Economy**
Restored airflow allows your engine to breathe properly again. Most customers report noticeably improved throttle response and better fuel consumption immediately after service.

✅ **Reduces or Eliminates Lag and Hesitation**
With proper air delivery restored, turbo lag and hesitation on acceleration are dramatically reduced or eliminated entirely.

## Our Comprehensive Intake Cleaning Service

**Intake Manifold Removal and Inspection**
We completely remove your intake manifold to assess contamination levels. This allows us to inspect components that are impossible to see with the manifold installed, including swirl flap condition and EGR passage contamination.

**Chemical Cleaning**
The intake manifold undergoes intensive chemical cleaning to dissolve and remove all carbon, oil, and soot deposits. We ensure all passages are completely clear and swirl flaps move freely.

![Professional chemical cleaning of intake manifold](/intake4.jpg)
*Intake manifold undergoing professional chemical cleaning to restore like-new condition*

**Intake Port Walnut Blasting**
For engines with significant valve and port contamination, we offer professional walnut shell blasting services. This gentle yet effective media removes carbon deposits from intake valves and ports without damaging aluminum surfaces.

![Walnut blasting service for intake ports](/intake2.jpg)
*Professional walnut blasting equipment removing carbon deposits from intake ports and valves*

**Complete Seal Replacement**
All intake manifold gaskets, seals, and O-rings are replaced with OEM or premium aftermarket components. This prevents vacuum leaks and ensures optimal sealing.

**Swirl Flap Solutions**
Based on our inspection, we provide recommendations for your swirl flaps:
- **Replacement**: For damaged or seized flaps
- **Removal/Blanking**: For preventative peace of mind
- **ECU Remapping**: To optimize engine operation if flaps are removed

![Swirl flap removal and blanking plates](/swirl-removal1.jpg)
*Swirl flap removal with blanking plates - eliminating the risk of catastrophic failure permanently*

**EGR System Inspection**
We also inspect your EGR cooler and pipes. Heavily contaminated EGR systems are cleaned or replaced as needed to prevent future intake contamination.

## Recommended Service Interval

We recommend intake manifold inspection and cleaning every **100,000 kilometers** for diesel BMWs. This interval provides the optimal balance between preventative maintenance and cost-effectiveness.

However, you should consider earlier service if you experience:
- Noticeable power loss or reduced performance
- Hesitation or lag on acceleration
- Decreased fuel economy
- Rough idle or uneven running
- Check engine lights related to airflow or EGR issues
- Excessive black smoke from the exhaust

## The Walnut Blasting Difference

Traditional intake cleaning methods can't address carbon buildup on intake valves and in intake ports. Walnut shell blasting uses crushed walnut shells—a soft, biodegradable media—propelled at high velocity to remove deposits.

**Why Walnut Shells?**
- Soft enough not to damage aluminum heads or valves
- Effective at removing stubborn carbon deposits
- Biodegradable and environmentally friendly
- Completely removed by vacuum during service

**The Results**
Intake port walnut blasting can restore intake valve sealing and airflow to near-factory specifications, dramatically improving engine performance on high-mileage diesel engines.

## Investment in Longevity

Professional intake manifold cleaning represents a fraction of the cost of potential failures:

- **Intake Manifold Cleaning Service**: From €285
- **Walnut Blasting Service**: From €300 (optional)
- **Swirl Flap Delete**: From €280 (optional)

## FAQs

**Q: How do I know if I have NBT or NBT EVO ID4? They look the same!**
A: This is the most common question! You MUST check via Navigation → Maps → Options → Navigation system version. If it shows "NBT_EVO_" you have NBT EVO (flashable to CarPlay). If it shows just "NEXT" or "NBT" you have standard NBT (not flashable). The visual appearance is identical, so the navigation version check is the only way to know for sure.

**Q: Will flashing ID4 to ID6 void my warranty?**
A: The software flash is fully reversible. We can flash back to stock before any dealer visits if needed.

**Q: Can I add Android Auto to NBT EVO ID6?**
A: Unfortunately, Android Auto is not natively supported on NBT EVO. Only MGU (iDrive 7.0) and newer support both CarPlay and Android Auto.

**Q: What's the difference between ID4 and ID5?**
A: ID4 looks like standard NBT (list-based menu), while ID5 has a tile-based interface. Both use the same hardware platform. ID5 already supports native CarPlay, while ID4 needs to be flashed to ID6. ID6 is the newest software version with the most features.

**Q: How long does the ID4→ID6 flash take?**
A: The process takes approximately 3 hours. It can be completed during the day - no overnight stay required.

**Q: Will my existing BMW functions still work?**
A: Yes! All BMW functions (navigation, ConnectedDrive, vehicle settings, etc.) remain fully functional. CarPlay is an additional feature.

# BMW Coding: What Features Can You Actually Unlock?

Modern BMWs are packed with features that may be hidden in your specific vehicle. Through professional coding, many of these can be activated without any hardware changes.

## What is BMW Coding?

BMW coding is the process of modifying software parameters in your vehicle's control modules. Think of it as unlocking features that are already built into your car but disabled by default based on your original specification or market.

## Popular Coding Options

### Comfort & Convenience

**Digital Speed Display**
Activate the digital speed readout in your instrument cluster or heads-up display. This is especially useful for vehicles imported from markets where it wasn't standard.

**Automatic Start/Stop Behavior**
Customize or disable the automatic start/stop function to suit your driving preferences.

**Comfort Access Enhancements**
- Automatic folding mirrors when locking
- One-touch window closing from key fob
- Trunk opening height adjustment

### Safety & Driver Assistance

**Speed Limit Info (SLI)**
If your car has the required camera, we can activate the speed limit display on your dashboard and HUD. Even without the camera, we can enable it using navigation data with an aftermarket emulator.

**Enhanced Lighting Options**
- Daytime running light configuration
- Welcome/goodbye light sequences
- Adaptive headlight settings

### Regional Features

**Navigation & Region Changes**
For imported vehicles, we can change the region coding to:
- Enable proper navigation for Ireland/Europe
- Update map data
- Disable market-specific warnings
- Adjust radio frequencies for local stations

## What Can't Be Coded?

It's important to understand the limitations:

**Hardware-Dependent Features**
You can't code features that require hardware you don't have. For example:
- Can't add heated seats without the heating elements
- Can't enable adaptive cruise without the necessary sensors
- Can't activate Harman Kardon sound without the amplifier

**Safety-Critical Systems**
We won't code changes that compromise vehicle safety or violate regulations:
- No airbag system modifications
- No ABS/DSC defeats
- No emission system tampering

## The Coding Process

1. **Diagnostic Scan**: We identify your vehicle's current configuration
2. **Feature Discussion**: We explain what's possible for your specific model
3. **Coding**: Using dealer-level diagnostic tools, we make the changes
4. **Testing**: Every coded feature is tested to ensure proper operation
5. **Vehicle Order Update**: Changes are logged in your vehicle's configuration

## Is Coding Safe?

**Yes, when done properly.** Our coding work:
- Uses official BMW diagnostic protocols
- Is fully reversible
- Doesn't affect warranty on unrelated components

## Popular Models for Coding

We regularly code features on:
- F-Series BMWs (F10, F30, F31, etc.)
- G-Series BMWs (G20, G30, G31, etc.)
- MINI Cooper (F55, F56, F57, etc.)

## Pricing

Coding services start from €45 for simple feature activations. Complex coding including region changes and navigation updates ranges from €250-€600 depending on your iDrive system.

# BMW Remapping Guide 2025: Everything You Need to Know

Thinking about remapping your BMW? This comprehensive guide covers everything from expected power gains to which models respond best to tuning.

## What is ECU Remapping?

ECU remapping (also called chiptuning or ECU tuning) involves modifying the software in your engine control unit to optimize performance, efficiency, or both. Modern BMWs are often conservatively tuned from the factory, leaving room for safe, reliable improvements.

## Stage 1 Remapping

- Software-only modifications
- No hardware changes required
- Optimized fuel and ignition maps
- Improved throttle response

**Best for:**
- Daily drivers
- Warranty-conscious owners
- Those wanting reliable, modest gains

**Typical gains:**
- Diesel: +40-50hp, +80-100Nm
- Petrol: +30-40hp, +50-80Nm

## Which BMW Models Remap Best?

### Diesel Champions
**BMW 320d / 520d (B47/N47 Engine)**
- Stock: 190hp / 400Nm
